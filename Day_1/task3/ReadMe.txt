How can you count the occurrence of 1 from 1 to 99,999,999 (1 short of 100 million) 
and total up how many 1s were there.

(Convert Numbers to String in Case one and use String Functions to Count 1s, 
Use Only Mathematical Functions and Numeric values in case 2 
and see the difference in performance) 
Is There Any Other Way to Do it in Approximately 1 Second or less
