Consider an Array of Integer values with size N, having values as in this Example

7	0	0	0	5	6	7	5	0	7	5	3

Your task will be to write a program find the longest distance between
Two equal cells. In this example. The distance is measured by the number
Of cells- for example, the distance between the first and the fourth cell is
2 (cell 2 and cell 3).
In the example above, the longest distance is between the first 7 and the
10th 7, with a distance of 8 cells, i.e. the number of cells between the 1st
And the 10th 7s.
Note:
- Array values will be taken from the user
- If you have input like 1111111 then the distance is the number of
Cells between the first and the last cell.
